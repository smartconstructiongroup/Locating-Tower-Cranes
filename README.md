# Locating-Tower-Cranes
Proposed model optimally determines the location, number and type of tower cranes required and the location and number of material supply points. Also, the height of overlapping cranes is determined to prevent cranes from colliding with each other and to reduce possible stops in the optimization process. This code is implemented in OPL software.
